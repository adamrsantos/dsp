[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>>The PMF isn't uniform. Each value is not evenly spaced out as you would expect if they were truly random. The CDF had bumps in it. If it were truly random, that would be a straight line with a slope of 1 and no bumps. Some values are more likely than others.
